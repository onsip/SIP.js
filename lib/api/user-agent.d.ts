 * The user agent also maintains the Transport over which its signaling travels.

     * NOTE: While this is a "graceful shutdown", it can also be very slow one if you
     * are waiting for the returned Promise to resolve. The disposal of the clients and
     * dialogs is done serially - waiting on one to finish before moving on to the next.
     * This can be slow if there are lot of subscriptions to unsubscribe for example.
     *
     * THE SLOW PACE IS INTENTIONAL!
     * While one could spin them all down in parallel, this could slam the remote server.
     * It is bad practice to denial of service attack (DoS attack) servers!!!
     * Moreover, production servers will automatically blacklist clients which send too
     * many requests in too short a period of time - dropping any additional requests.
     *
     * If a different approach to disposing is needed, one can implement whatever is
     * needed and execute that prior to calling `stop()`. Alternatively one may simply
     * not wait for the Promise returned by `stop()` to complete.
