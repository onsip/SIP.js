    /**

     * @remarks
     * TLDR...
     *  1) Only one offer/answer exchange permitted during initial INVITE.
     *  2) No "early media" if the initial offer is in an INVITE (default behavior).
     *  3) If "early media" and the initial offer is in an INVITE, no INVITE forking.
     *
     * 1) Only one offer/answer exchange permitted during initial INVITE.
     *
     * Our implementation replaces the following bullet point...
     *
     * o  After having sent or received an answer to the first offer, the
     *    UAC MAY generate subsequent offers in requests based on rules
     *    specified for that method, but only if it has received answers
     *    to any previous offers, and has not sent any offers to which it
     *    hasn't gotten an answer.
     * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#section-13.2.1
     *
     * ...with...
     *
     * o  After having sent or received an answer to the first offer, the
     *    UAC MUST NOT generate subsequent offers in requests based on rules
     *    specified for that method.
     *
     * ...which in combination with this bullet point...
     *
     * o  Once the UAS has sent or received an answer to the initial
     *    offer, it MUST NOT generate subsequent offers in any responses
     *    to the initial INVITE.  This means that a UAS based on this
     *    specification alone can never generate subsequent offers until
     *    completion of the initial transaction.
     * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#section-13.2.1
     *
     * ...ensures that EXACTLY ONE offer/answer exchange will occur
     * during an initial out of dialog INVITE request made by our UAC.
     *
     *
     * 2) No "early media" if the initial offer is in an INVITE (default behavior).
     *
     * While our implementation adheres to the following bullet point...
     *
     * o  If the initial offer is in an INVITE, the answer MUST be in a
     *    reliable non-failure message from UAS back to UAC which is
     *    correlated to that INVITE.  For this specification, that is
     *    only the final 2xx response to that INVITE.  That same exact
     *    answer MAY also be placed in any provisional responses sent
     *    prior to the answer.  The UAC MUST treat the first session
     *    description it receives as the answer, and MUST ignore any
     *    session descriptions in subsequent responses to the initial
     *    INVITE.
     * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#section-13.2.1
     *
     * We have made the following implementation decision with regard to early media...
     *
     * o  If the initial offer is in the INVITE, the answer from the
     *    UAS back to the UAC will establish a media session only
     *    only after the final 2xx response to that INVITE is received.
     *
     * The reason for this decision is rooted in a restriction currently
     * inherent in WebRTC. Specifically, while a SIP INVITE request with an
     * initial offer may fork resulting in more than one provisional answer,
     * there is currently no easy/good way to to "fork" an offer generated
     * by a peer connection. In particular, a WebRTC offer currently may only
     * be matched with one answer and we have no good way to know which
     * "provisional answer" is going to be the "final answer". So we have
     * decided to punt and not create any "early media" sessions in this case.
     *
     * The upshot is that if you want "early media", you must not put the
     * initial offer in the INVITE. Instead, force the UAS to provide the
     * initial offer by sending an INVITE without an offer. In the WebRTC
     * case this allows us to create a unique peer connection with a unique
     * answer for every provisional offer with "early media" on all of them.
     *
     *
     * 3) If "early media" and the initial offer is in an INVITE, no INVITE forking.
     *
     * The default behavior may be altered and "early media" utilized if the
     * initial offer is in the an INVITE by setting the `earlyMedia` options.
     * However in that case the INVITE request MUST NOT fork. This allows for
     * "early media" in environments where the forking behavior of the SIP
     * servers being utilized is configured to disallow forking.

    /**
     * 13.2.1 Creating the Initial INVITE
     *
     * Since the initial INVITE represents a request outside of a dialog,
     * its construction follows the procedures of Section 8.1.1.  Additional
     * processing is required for the specific case of INVITE.
     *
     * An Allow header field (Section 20.5) SHOULD be present in the INVITE.
     * It indicates what methods can be invoked within a dialog, on the UA
     * sending the INVITE, for the duration of the dialog.  For example, a
     * UA capable of receiving INFO requests within a dialog [34] SHOULD
     * include an Allow header field listing the INFO method.
     *
     * A Supported header field (Section 20.37) SHOULD be present in the
     * INVITE.  It enumerates all the extensions understood by the UAC.
     *
     * An Accept (Section 20.1) header field MAY be present in the INVITE.
     * It indicates which Content-Types are acceptable to the UA, in both
     * the response received by it, and in any subsequent requests sent to
     * it within dialogs established by the INVITE.  The Accept header field
     * is especially useful for indicating support of various session
     * description formats.
     *
     * The UAC MAY add an Expires header field (Section 20.19) to limit the
     * validity of the invitation.  If the time indicated in the Expires
     * header field is reached and no final answer for the INVITE has been
     * received, the UAC core SHOULD generate a CANCEL request for the
     * INVITE, as per Section 9.
     *
     * A UAC MAY also find it useful to add, among others, Subject (Section
     * 20.36), Organization (Section 20.25) and User-Agent (Section 20.41)
     * header fields.  They all contain information related to the INVITE.
     *
     * The UAC MAY choose to add a message body to the INVITE.  Section
     * 8.1.1.10 deals with how to construct the header fields -- Content-
     * Type among others -- needed to describe the message body.
