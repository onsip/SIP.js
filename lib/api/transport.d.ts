/**
 * Transport layer interface expected by the `UserAgent`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The transport behaves in a deterministic manner according to the
 * the state defined in {@link TransportState}.
 *
 * The "Connecting" state is ONLY entered in response to the user calling `connect()`.
 * The "Disconnecting" state is ONLY entered in response to the user calling `disconnect()`.
 * The `onConnect` callback is ALWAYS called upon transitioning to the "Connected" state.
 * The `onDisconnect` callback is ALWAYS called upon transitioning from the "Connected" state.
 *
 * Adherence to the state machine by the transport implementation is critical as the
 * UserAgent depends on this behavior. Furthermore it is critical that the transport
 * transition to the "Disconnected" state in all instances where network connectivity
 * is lost as the UserAgent, API, and application layer more generally depend on knowing
 * network was lost. For example, from a practical standpoint registrations and subscriptions are invalidated
 * when network is lost - particularly in the case of connection oriented transport
 * protocols such as a secure WebSocket transport.
 *
 * Proper handling the application level protocol recovery must be left to the application layer,
 * thus the transport MUST NOT attempt to "auto-recover" from or otherwise hide loss of network.
 * Note that callbacks and emitters such as `onConnect`  and `onDisconnect` MUST NOT call methods
 * `connect()` and `direct()` synchronously (state change handlers must not loop back). They may
 * however do so asynchronously using a Promise resolution, `setTimeout`, or some other method.
 * For example...
 * ```ts
 * transport.onDisconnect = () => {
 *   Promise.resolve().then(() => transport.connect());
 * }
 * ```
