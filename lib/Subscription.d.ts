     * The following events are emitted...
     *  - "accepted" A 200-class final response to a SUBSCRIBE request was received.
     *  - "failed" A non-200-class final response to a SUBSCRIBE request was received.
     *  - "rejected" Emitted immediately after a "failed" event (yes, it's redundant).
     *  - "notify" A NOTIFY request was received.
     *  - "terminated" The subscription is moving to or has moved to a terminated state.
     *
     * More than one SUBSCRIBE request may be sent, so "accepted", "failed" and "rejected"
     * may be emitted multiple times. However these event will NOT be emitted for SUBSCRIBE
     * requests with expires of zero (unsubscribe requests).
     *
     * Note that a "terminated" event does NOT indicate the subscription is in the "terminated"
     * state as described in RFC 6665. Instead, a "terminated" event indicates that this class
     * is no longer usable and/or is in the process of becoming no longer usable.
     *
     * The order the events are emitted in is not deterministic. Some examples...
     *  - "accepted" may occur multiple times
     *  - "accepted" may follow "notify" and "notify" may follow "accepted"
     *  - "terminated" may follow "accepted" and "accepted" may follow "terminated"
     *  - "terminated" may follow "notify" and "notify" may follow "terminated"
     *
     * Hint: Experience suggests one workable approach to utilizing these events
     * is to make use of "notify" and "terminated" only. That is, call `subscribe()`
     * and if a "notify" occurs then you have a subscription. If a "terminated"
     * event occurs then either a new subscription failed to be established or an
     * established subscription has terminated or is in the process of terminating.
     * Note that "notify" events may follow a "terminated" event, but experience
     * suggests it is reasonable to discontinue usage of this class after receipt
     * of a "terminated" event. The other events are informational, but as they do not
     * arrive in a deterministic manner it is difficult to make use of them otherwise.
     *
     * @param name Event name.
     * @param callback Callback.
