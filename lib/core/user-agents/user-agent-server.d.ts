 * accepts, rejects, or redirects the request.  This role lasts
 * only for the duration of that transaction.  In other words, if
 * a piece of software responds to a request, it acts as a UAS for
 * the duration of that transaction.  If it generates a request
 * later, it assumes the role of a user agent client for the
 * processing of that transaction.
