     * Terminating a Session
     *
     * This section describes the procedures for terminating a session
     * established by SIP.  The state of the session and the state of the
     * dialog are very closely related.  When a session is initiated with an
     * INVITE, each 1xx or 2xx response from a distinct UAS creates a
     * dialog, and if that response completes the offer/answer exchange, it
     * also creates a session.  As a result, each session is "associated"
     * with a single dialog - the one which resulted in its creation.  If an
     * initial INVITE generates a non-2xx final response, that terminates
     * all sessions (if any) and all dialogs (if any) that were created
     * through responses to the request.  By virtue of completing the
     * transaction, a non-2xx final response also prevents further sessions
     * from being created as a result of the INVITE.  The BYE request is
     * used to terminate a specific session or attempted session.  In this
     * case, the specific session is the one with the peer UA on the other
     * side of the dialog.  When a BYE is received on a dialog, any session
     * associated with that dialog SHOULD terminate.  A UA MUST NOT send a
     * BYE outside of a dialog.  The caller's UA MAY send a BYE for either
     * confirmed or early dialogs, and the callee's UA MAY send a BYE on
     * confirmed dialogs, but MUST NOT send a BYE on early dialogs.
     *
     * However, the callee's UA MUST NOT send a BYE on a confirmed dialog
     * until it has received an ACK for its 2xx response or until the server
     * transaction times out.  If no SIP extensions have defined other
     * application layer states associated with the dialog, the BYE also
     * terminates the dialog.
     *

     * @param options - BYE options bucket.
     * @returns
     * Throws `Error` if callee's UA attempts a BYE on an early dialog.
     * Throws `Error` if callee's UA attempts a BYE on a confirmed dialog
     *                while it's waiting on the ACK for its 2xx response.

     *
     * A successful INVITE request (see Section 13) establishes both a
     * dialog between two user agents and a session using the offer-answer
     * model.  Section 12 explains how to modify an existing dialog using a

     * that established the session.  An INVITE request sent within an
     * existing dialog is known as a re-INVITE.
