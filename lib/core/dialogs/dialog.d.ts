 * Dialog.
 * @remarks
 * A key concept for a user agent is that of a dialog.  A dialog
 * represents a peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two user agents
 * that persists for some time.  The dialog facilitates sequencing of
 * messages between the user agents and proper routing of requests
 * between both of them.  The dialog represents a context in which to
 * interpret SIP messages.
