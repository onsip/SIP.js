/**
 * Transaction
 *
 * SIP is a transactional protocol: interactions between components take
 * place in a series of independent message exchanges.  Specifically, a
 * SIP transaction consists of a single request and any responses to
 * that request, which include zero or more provisional responses and
 * one or more final responses.  In the case of a transaction where the
 * request was an INVITE (known as an INVITE transaction), the
 * transaction also includes the ACK only if the final response was not
 * a 2xx response.  If the response was a 2xx, the ACK is not considered
 * part of the transaction.
 * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#section-17
