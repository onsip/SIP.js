 * Client Transaction
 *

 * The TU communicates with the client transaction through a simple
 * interface.  When the TU wishes to initiate a new transaction, it
 * creates a client transaction and passes it the SIP request to send
 * and an IP address, port, and transport to which to send it.  The
 * client transaction begins execution of its state machine.  Valid
 * responses are passed up to the TU from the client transaction.
