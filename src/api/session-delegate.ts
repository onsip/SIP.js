   * It's recommended that the SessionDescriptionHandler be accessed via the `Session.sessionDescriptionHandler` property.
   * However there are use cases where one needs access immediately after it is constructed and before it is utilized.
   * Thus this callback.
   *
   * In most scenarios a single SessionDescriptionHandler will be created per Session
   * in which case this callback will be called at most once and `provisional` will be `false`.
   *
   * However if reliable provisional responses are being supported and an INVITE is sent without SDP,
   * one or more session description handlers will be created if remote offers are received in reliable provisional responses.
   * When remote offers are received in reliable provisional responses, the `provisional` parameter will be `true`.
   * When the `provisional` paramter is `true`, this callback may (or may not) be called again.
   * If the session is ultimately established using a SessionDescriptionHandler which was not created provisionally,
   * this callback will be called again and the `provisional` parameter will be `false`.
   * If the session is ultimately established using a SessionDescriptionHandler which was created provisionally,
   * this callback will not be called again.
   * Note that if the session is ultimately established using a SessionDescriptionHandler which was created provisionally,
   * the provisional SessionDescriptionHandler being utilized will be available via the `Session.sessionDescriptionHandler` property.
   *
   * @param sessionDescriptionHandler - The handler.
   * @param provisional - True if created provisionally.
