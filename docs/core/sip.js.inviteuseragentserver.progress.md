## InviteUserAgentServer.progress() method

13.3.1.1 Progress If the UAS is not able to answer the invitation immediately, it can choose to indicate some kind of progress to the UAC (for example, an indication that a phone is ringing). This is accomplished with a provisional response between 101 and 199. These provisional responses establish early dialogs and therefore follow the procedures of Section 12.1.1 in addition to those of Section 8.2.6. A UAS MAY send as many provisional responses as it likes. Each of these MUST indicate the same dialog ID. However, these will not be delivered reliably.

If the UAS desires an extended period of time to answer the INVITE, it will need to ask for an "extension" in order to prevent proxies from canceling the transaction. A proxy has the option of canceling a transaction when there is a gap of 3 minutes between responses in a transaction. To prevent cancellation, the UAS MUST send a non-100 provisional response at every minute, to handle the possibility of lost provisional responses. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-13.3.1.1
