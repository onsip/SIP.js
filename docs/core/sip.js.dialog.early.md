## Dialog.early property

A dialog can also be in the "early" state, which occurs when it is created with a provisional response, and then it transition to the "confirmed" state when a 2xx final response received or is sent.

Note: RFC 3261 is concise on when a dialog is "confirmed", but it can be a point of confusion if an INVITE dialog is "confirmed" after a 2xx is sent or after receiving the ACK for the 2xx response. With careful reading it can be inferred a dialog is always is "confirmed" when the 2xx is sent (regardless of type of dialog). However a INVITE dialog does have additional considerations when it is confirmed but an ACK has not yet been received (in particular with regard to a callee sending BYE requests).
