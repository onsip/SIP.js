## Dialog.receiveRequest() method

Requests sent within a dialog, as any other requests, are atomic. If a particular request is accepted by the UAS, all the state changes associated with it are performed. If the request is rejected, none of the state changes are performed.

Note that some requests, such as INVITEs, affect several pieces of state.
