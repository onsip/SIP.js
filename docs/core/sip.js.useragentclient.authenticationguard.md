## UserAgentClient.authenticationGuard() method

If a 401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response is received, the UAC SHOULD follow the authorization procedures of Section 22.2 and Section 22.3 to retry the request with credentials. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-8.1.3.5 22 Usage of HTTP Authentication https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-22 22.1 Framework https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-22.1 22.2 User-to-User Authentication https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-22.2 22.3 Proxy-to-User Authentication https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-22.3

FIXME: This "guard for and retry the request with credentials" implementation is not complete and at best minimally passable.
