## IncomingRequestDelegate.onCancel() method

Receive CANCEL request. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-9.2 Note: Currently CANCEL is being handled as a special case.

As such, there is currently no way to externally impact the response to the a CANCEL request and thus the method here is receiving a "message" (as apposed to a "uas").
