## UserAgentClient.onRequestTimeout() method

8.1.3.1 Transaction Layer Errors In some cases, the response returned by the transaction layer will not be a SIP message, but rather a transaction layer error. When a timeout error is received from the transaction layer, it MUST be treated as if a 408 (Request Timeout) status code has been received. If a fatal transport error is reported by the transport layer (generally, due to fatal ICMP errors in UDP or connection failures in TCP), the condition MUST be treated as a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-8.1.3.1

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
protected onRequestTimeout(): void;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`void`
