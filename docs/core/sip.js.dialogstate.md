## DialogState interface

Dialog state.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface DialogState 
```

## Remarks

A dialog contains certain pieces of state needed for further message transmissions within the dialog. This state consists of the dialog ID, a local sequence number (used to order requests from the UA to its peer), a remote sequence number (used to order requests from its peer to the UA), a local URI, a remote URI, remote target, a boolean flag called "secure", and a route set, which is an ordered list of URIs. The route set is the list of servers that need to be traversed to send a request to the peer. A dialog can also be in the "early" state, which occurs when it is created with a provisional response, and then transition to the "confirmed" state when a 2xx final response arrives. For other responses, or if no response arrives at all on that dialog, the early dialog terminates.
