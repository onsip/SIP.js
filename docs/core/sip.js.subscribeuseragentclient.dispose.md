## SubscribeUserAgentClient.dispose() method

Destructor. Note that Timer N may live on waiting for an initial NOTIFY and the delegate may still receive that NOTIFY. If you don't want that behavior then either clear the delegate so the delegate doesn't get called (a 200 will be sent in response to the NOTIFY) or call `waitNotifyStop` which will clear Timer N and remove this UAC from the core (a 481 will be sent in response to the NOTIFY).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
dispose(): void;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`void`
